# Startup Pitch Perfect

Startup Pitch Perfect - [battledecks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerpoint-Karaoke) for startups.

Startup Pitch Perfect automatically generates a random startup and all slides of a standard pitch deck
(e.g. market, product, strategy, team) based on the __"X for Y"__ trope to pitch to your friends. Now it's your turn!

This project makes use of [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), [ChartNew.js](https://github.com/FVANCOP/ChartNew.js)
(an extension of [Chart.js](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js)), and [WTFEngine](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine).

A demo can be found [here](http://startuppitchperfect.sebastianruder.com/).
